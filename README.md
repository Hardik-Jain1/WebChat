# WebChat
ChatBot uses the RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) technique to interact with a given website URL and answer the questions about that website.

It enables users to interact with it, provide inputs, and receive relevant responses within the notebook. This Chatbot uses the RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) technique to get the web scraped data, store it in a vector database, and then retrieve the relevant context from it (w.r.t to the asked question) to provide it to the LLM(ChatGPT) along with question which then generates the relevant output.
